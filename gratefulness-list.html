            <p>An amazing technique to make myself feel happy and excited about life practically immediately…. I’ve tried and tested it, and it works… I need to a make a list of 200 items, at least 50 of what I’m grateful for today. And the more I write, the happier I start feeling with each item. When practiced regularly, I can start feeling overjoyed on the 5th item on the list. </p>
    <p>I tested that theory when I was hand making a gift for one of my boyfriends and I decided to write 200 reasons about what I love or like about him. Due to the fact that I had to concentrate on the task and really think about it, by the time I got to the 200th item, I really felt that I had strong feelings for him and that’s considering the fact that our relationship wasn’t perfect.</p>
    <p>Recently I had a chance to try this theory on myself for two days in a row when I started writing a list of reasons why I love myself… The key is starting with… I love myself… without mattering what comes next… Both days after writing a certain amount of items, I started feeling really happy and overjoyed. And I enjoyed having that feeling. I started feeling happy and smiling to everyone at work, and I was genuinely happy.
    </p>
    <p>So I think that this technique could be applied to anything. Whatever I don’t want to do. If I start writing at least 100 reasons why I love doing it, it could make me feel excited about the task and would help pump me up. It’s the best technique that has worked for me so far to make myself happy practically immediately.</p>
